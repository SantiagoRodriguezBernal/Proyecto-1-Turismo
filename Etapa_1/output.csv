First part of the tour was Rivera's actual home where he lived with his parents. Pretty cool and then you keep climbing to the exhibit floors. The only work by Rivera were of early sketches. Rough drafts in one and pencil which he probably meant to throw away. The rest of the exhibits belonged to unknown artists pretty let down. Has clean restrooms.,2
